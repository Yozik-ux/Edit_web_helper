 This is a bot for detecting grammatical, punctuation, lexical, and spelling errors. The bot is configured for the Ukrainian language (but you can change it to any language). Specifically, I used the LanguageTool service   for personal purposes only.

To use it, change this variable
TOKEN = "you tg-bot token"
to your Telegram bot token.
